Hi,

For this first section, I was a bit lost about what to do, so I did my first mini-project to integrate the Bootstrap elements and see how they work. This was a kind of blog with cards, buttons, navbars, a bit of CSS, and the HTML knowledge that I gained through the first lessons.

Hopefully, this will be okay to show that I covered the first section's elements. Sorry about not being that careful to follow every assignment step by step and integrate them all in this. Also, I did not pay too much attention to comments, but in retrospect, it shows me how I improved through the knowledge curve.

Many thanks.
